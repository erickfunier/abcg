# ABCg

Development framework accompanying the course [MCTA008-17 Computer Graphics](http://professor.ufabc.edu.br/~harlen.batagelo/cg/) at [UFABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/).

A classic game, with a hint of difficulty, the Nested Tic-Tac-Toe consists of nine Tic-Tac-Toe games that together form a Tic-Tac-Toe, increasing the difficulty, since any of the games can be done simultaneously, with a distraction the player loses easily.
The code was made using the ABCg library, with OpenGL, the menu, and the buttons on each board were made with ImGui and the lines and columns, in addition to the end-of-game trace, were made with Open graphics.
