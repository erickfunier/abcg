# RUN! from UFABC

This is the last project of ABCg's first series. This time, the project contains an object made in Maya. Using normal map and brick texture.

Two texture maps are loaded _Diffuse_ and _Normal_, and the _mappingMode_ is defined to use information from the _mesh_ and the object is created using a cube, then exported to Obj.
The lighting and shadow are based on the Blinn-Phong model, but we use only a fixed point of light, simulating an open environment.

The user can move with the keys W, A, S, D (Up, Left, Down, Right-Arrow) and Q, E.

The environment follows the idea of a maze, but it looks more like a construction, when you get to the other side the user can enjoy a view with the UFABC Clock Tower. In addition, there is a ladder that the user can climb and enjoy the roof.

The game can be accessed in web version:
